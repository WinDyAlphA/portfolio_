## Introduction

After completing Dante, I jumped straight into Zephyr, the final prolab needed for my CPTS certification.

This prolab was intense and definitely stepped up the difficulty from Dante.

## So many reviews

I won't provide a detailed review, plenty of others already did that.

This is a challenging Active Directory-focused lab with realistic enterprise scenarios. Perfect for CPTS preparation and AD enumeration practice.

## Rating: 4/5

More challenging and stable than Dante. The machines were well-designed with realistic AD misconfigurations. Had few stability issues compared to Dante.

Some challenges required deep enumeration and thinking outside the box, which was both frustrating and rewarding.

Completed in about 3-4 weeks part-time while working on CPTS modules.
