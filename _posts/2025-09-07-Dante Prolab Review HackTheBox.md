## Introduction

Long time no see, I was working on the CPTS and this prolab.

For the CPTS, I'll wait until I flag the Zephyr prolab then this should be good

So this prolab was a lot of fun and headaches.

## Overview

Dante is one of HackTheBox's most challenging prolabs, designed to simulate a realistic corporate network environment. This prolab focuses heavily on Active Directory exploitation, lateral movement, and privilege escalation techniques across multiple interconnected machines.

The lab consists of 14 machines total, with a mix of Windows and Linux systems that form a complex network topology. What makes Dante particularly challenging is the realistic network segmentation and the need to pivot through multiple systems to reach your final objectives.

## Initial Approach

Starting with the external foothold, I began by enumerating the exposed services on the perimeter machines. The initial reconnaissance phase was crucial, as it set the tone for the entire engagement.

The first machine required careful enumeration of web services and identifying potential entry points. Once I gained initial access, the real challenge began - understanding the network topology and identifying potential pivot points.

## Key Learning Points

### Active Directory Exploitation
This prolab provided excellent practice with:
- Kerberoasting attacks
- ASREPRoasting
- Golden/Silver ticket attacks
- DCSync attacks
- Bloodhound enumeration and analysis

### Lateral Movement Techniques
The network design forced me to master various lateral movement techniques:
- **LIGOLO-NG** (this tool is amazing!)
- WinRM exploitation
- SMB relay attacks
- Pass-the-hash attacks
- Port forwarding and tunneling



## Challenges Faced

The most significant challenges I encountered were:

1. **Environment Issues**: The machines in the lab are unresponsive a lot of the time. This is honestly the biggest challenge - having to wait for a reset to test again what you did hours ago.
2. **Note-taking Chaos**: Keeping track of all the credentials, findings, and network paths was a mess. I'm just not used to managing notes on such large networks.

## Tools and Techniques Used

Throughout this engagement, I relied heavily on:
- **Bloodhound** for AD enumeration and attack path identification
- **Impacket suite** for various AD attacks
- **Ligolo-ng** for tunneling and port forwarding
- **CrackMapExec/NetExec** for credential validation and lateral movement
- **Rubeus** for Kerberos-related attacks

## Final Thoughts

Dante is an excellent prolab for anyone looking to improve their Active Directory skills in a realistic environment. The network design closely mimics real-world corporate environments, making the skills learned directly applicable to actual penetration testing engagements.

The difficulty curve is well-balanced, starting with more straightforward exploitation techniques and gradually introducing more complex attack chains. Each machine builds upon the knowledge gained from previous systems, creating a cohesive learning experience.

I would still recommend this prolab to anyone preparing for certifications like OSCP, CPTS, etc.

## Rating: 3.5/5

Dante gets a 3.5/5 from me. It's challenging and educational, but the environment issues with unresponsive machines really hurt the experience. When it works, it's great, but the technical problems are frustrating.

Time to complete: About 3-4 weeks of part-time work (would've been faster without all the resets...).

Next up: Zephyr prolab for the CPTS certification!
