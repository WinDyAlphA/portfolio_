## Introduction

Long time no see, I was working on the CPTS and this prolab.

So this prolab was a lot of fun and headaches.

## So many reviews

I won't provide a detailed review, plenty of others already did that.

Great for pivoting practice and the network design feels realistic. Definitely recommend it if you're preparing for OSCP or CPTS.

## Rating: 3.5/5

Solid lab overall, but had frequent issues with machines becoming unresponsive. When everything works properly it's excellent, but the stability problems were frustrating.

Completed in about 3-4 weeks part-time (would have been faster without waiting for the resets).
